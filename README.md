# Real Estate Data Analysis and House Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on analyzing real estate data and building a house price prediction application using Streamlit. The project aims to provide insights from the data and create a user-friendly app for predicting house prices based on various factors.

## Project Components
The project consists of the following major components:

1. **Data Analysis Report and Dashboard**
   - Analyzed the real estate dataset to extract valuable insights.
   - Created a dashboard to visually represent the analysis findings.
   - Tools used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI.

2. **House Price Prediction App**
   - Developed a Streamlit web application for predicting house prices.
   - Utilized machine learning models to make predictions.
   - Tools used: Python, Scikit-learn, Streamlit.

## File Structure
- `/data`: Contains the real estate dataset used for analysis and prediction.
- `/functions`: Contains Python scripts for scrapping data from source.
- `/notebooks`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration and feature engineering.
- `/references`: Contains a data dictionary.
- `/tests`:  Contains test scripts to test Python scripts.
- `/prediction_app`: Contains files for the Streamlit house price prediction app.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**: Gathered real estate data from a popular real estate website using the Requests and Beautiful Soup libraries and preprocessed it for analysis and prediction.
2. **Data Analysis**: Explored and analyzed the dataset to derive meaningful insights.
3. **Dashboard Creation**: Visualized insights through a dashboard for easy understanding and interpretation.
4. **Machine Learning Model**: Developed and trained models to predict house prices.
5. **App Development**: Built the Streamlit app integrating the predictive model for user interaction.
